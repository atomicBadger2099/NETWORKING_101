IP APPRESSES:NOTES


Ip addresses are network address assignments. They are considered to reside
on layer 3 of the OSI model, the network layer. They take place throuth
the router of your network. It is effectively the address you have on the network.

different classes of IP addresses exist:
  class A: giant institutions/corporations networks
  class B: medium sized institutions  networks
  class C: household or small business networks

IP addresses can be translated to IPV6/IPV4 addressing.
  IPV$ is the old method. We ran out of these. It was 32 bit.
  IPV6 is the new method used to accomodate more addresses. It is 128-bit.

all these record 0's and 1's as a language: example:

128:  64:  32:  16:  8:  4:  2:  1:
0      0    0    0    0  1   1   1         =   7.

128:  64:  32:  16:  8:  4:  2:  1:
1      1    1    1    1  1   1   1         =   255.

NAT - network address translation
  NAT and subnetting allow for multiple subnetworks within a local network.
  this extends the use of networks to temporarily get past the IPV4 issue.

COMMANDS FOR FINDING YOUR IP ADDRESS:
  POWERSHELL:  Get-NetIPConfiguration; Get-NetIPAddress | Format-List

  LINUX:  ipconfig
