SOME BASIC DEFINITIONS:

ETHERNET FRAMES- protocol data unit that runs through the layers of the OSI model in differing pieces
MAC ADDRESS- an address identifier physically burned into every network card
IP ADDRESS- internet address on the network
PORTS AND PORT NUMBERS - deliver data from IP ADDRESSES to computer applications 
API- application programming interface
SESSION- interactive exchange between two internet devices over a network


LAYERS:

7: APPLICATION LAYER:
   -APIs live here, creating environments for application function
   - where data interacts with the local computer application

6: PRESENTATION LAYER:
   -encryption, translation, and comprehension of the data by the system happen here.
   -used to be vital to convert document types
   -now important for encryption

5: SESSION LAYER:
   -makes the actual connection to the remote host
   -connects from internet to a web or email server, a database, ect.
       (the endpoints of the data transaction, where its held on other end)
   -uses PORT NUMBERS to get data from the IP ADDRESS to the right application in exchange.
   -uses SOURCE and DESTINATION PORT NUMBERS from the ETHERNET FRAME todeliver to the application points.

4: TRANSPORT LAYER:
   -job is to assemble and disassemble data pieces as they a rrice
   -data "train station"
   -data arrives in pieces, not whole amounts
   -data can only arrive in 1500 byte max chunks; if larger, ships in pieces of that size.

3: NETWORK LAYER:
   -IP ADDRESSING happens here.
   -MAC ADDRESSES are not sufficient for sending data across the internet.
       (IP ADDRESSES do this instead)
   -the ETHERNET FRAME, stripped down to an IP PACKET, contains source and 
       destination IP ADDRESSES.These are recognized and removed from the 
       Ethernet frame/IP packet, then sent upward to the next layer if it passes.

2: DATA LINK LAYER:
   -transfer between data nodes on a local network.
   -the Ethernet protocol happens here.
   -makes sure Ethernet frames reach the right place
   -determines proper location based on the MAC address
   -after MAC ADDRESS is removed, the Ethernet frame is now known as an IP PACKET.
       (the source MAC ADDRESS is kept for future return sending)

1: PHYSICAL LAYER:
   -physical connection between devices.
   -Bit and symbol are on layer 1.
   -job is to make sure 1's and 0's travel between different hosts.
   -wires, frequency, ect.
   -layer 1 catches the entire Ethernet frame as it comes in.
   -layer 1 recognizws the preamble on the Ethernet frame, removes it, 
        and sends it up to the next layer.
   -also layer 1 recognizes and removes the frame check sequence from the Ethernet frame.
       (destination MAC ADDRESS is part of the Ethernet frame - gets removed)
